# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to take the city and ride data previously provided to us and create a new summary and visualization based on city type. We first created a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, which summarized ride, driver and fare data for Rural, Suburban and Urban city types. We then created a line graph showing weekly total fares by city type for a four month period in 2019, from January 1st through April 29th.

## Analysis Results: 
### City Type DataFrame
While reviewing the DataFrame we had compiled of the ride sharing data per city type, we could see the differences between each city type as illustrated in the following table:

![Summary_by_City_Type](https://github.com/jmueller187/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Summary_by_City_Type.png)

This table provides the following information:
- The Rural cities had the lowest amount of rides and drivers, almost 31 times less than the Urban cities. This resulted in the lowest amount of total fares and the highest average fare per ride and per driver.
- Results from the Suburban cities showed them falling in between the Rural and Urban cities in all categories. 
- The largest amount of rides and drivers were found in the Urban cities, which resultied in the highest amount of total fares and lowest average fare per ride and per driver.

### Total Fare by Cit Type Line Graph


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
